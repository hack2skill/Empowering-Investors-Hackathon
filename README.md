## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Our created solution is able to convert video files into audio, then into text accurately, and is able to predict whether the data is misleading or not. Our solution is able to work on audio, video, and images. We have a platform where common people can investigate the claims and give feedback on the influencers. This data will be in the database and will help us to score influencers. With a little more processing power in hand, we will be able to analyze all YouTube videos of an influencer and give a conclusion. We are also able to scrape data from telegram pages and Twitter.
