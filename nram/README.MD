## A Brief of the Prototype:
  At the prototype level:

- We offer an immersive speech based solution where users can have 
- Interactive conversation with the AI model
- The model as a personalized AI companion that helps in portfolio specific way based on the user queries to- optimize their financial understanding.
- The knowledge of current insights and trends of the market.
- Comfort of limited typing ability or prefer verbal communication.
- discover new investment opportunities and strategies
- More market experience with each interaction
- Get Tip of the day to learn more everyday.
- All the interactions are saved so that every next conversation could be more personalised to the user than before.
Further, we have planned to include a points based system where each interaction gives more user specific experience (exp) points. The model will also provide external links to get more insights on the given scenario as a reference.
