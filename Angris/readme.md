## A Brief of the Prototype:
 
  - We are using fine-tuned GPT with chain of thought prompting to generate the screenplay for the advertisement
  - The screenplay provides insights which is directed towards stable diffusion to generate the scene environments
  - The textual screenplay is converted into mp3 using Google Wavenet
  - Programming and frame manupilation is used with the GPT generated screenplay to generate the final video

## Tech Stack: 
   - GPT3.5 API 
   - Stable Diffusion
   - Google Wavenet
   - Python Flask Server
   - MongoDD
   - Azure VM
   - Netlify

   
## What we Learned:
   - Chain of thought prompting techniques
   - Integrating responses from different GenAI models  
   - Building an end to end pipeline for video generation from fundamentals
