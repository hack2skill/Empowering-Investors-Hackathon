# Empowering-Investors-Hackathon

#### Team Name - SEBICops
#### Problem Statement - Identifying Misleading Claims
#### Team Leader Email - mayur_madnani@intuit.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
The proposal is to run an unsupervised clustering algorithm using existing and crafted features to create different clusters for influencers who :
- Run for sponsorships
- Self-promote to sell their courses and merchandise
- Increase YouTube engagement by reiterating on like, subscribe, comment
- Genuine informative videos
  
## Tech Stack: 
- Python 3.11+ (Programming Language)
- Data Processing Module (e.g. Pandas, Spark)
- Clustering Module (e.g. KNN)
- Visualization Module (Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Dashboard interface (Streamlit)
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
Pre-requisite:
Setup Python environment with the below dependencies:
- numpy
- pandas
- plotly
- feather
- scikit-learn
- streamlit

Run the app
`streamlit run sebi_cops_streamlit_app.py`
  
## What I Learned:
Not all the content from influencers can be trusted blindly. An individual's sound judgement even from selective influencers is necessary
Technically, we learned a lot about data integration, feature engineering, and applying ML concepts to real-world scenarios
